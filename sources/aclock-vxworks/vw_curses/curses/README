This is curses for VxWorks 4.0.2. 

Curses allows you to manage text windows nicely, including scrolling of
arbitrary rectangular text regions, overlapping windows, etc. 

For the VxWorks version, I added semaphore locking to curses so that multiple 
processes can use it. 

Usual disclaimer: This software is provided ``as is'' and without any express
or implied warranties. My employer (ISTS) is in no way responsible for its 
contents. Any bugs you encounter you will have to fix yourself.

Caution: The curses.h include file defines the preprocessor macros OK and ERR.
Unfortunately, VxWorks also defines OK, and does so differently. My solution
has been to use VX_OK for VxWorks instead (see h/stdio.h), and let curses
have OK. You may want to do things the other way around, so I also define
CURSES_OK. Your code must then fix the OK macro after #including curses.h.

Good luck. If you have any questions, improvements, bug fixes, etc. send
them to georg@sgl.ists.ca.
