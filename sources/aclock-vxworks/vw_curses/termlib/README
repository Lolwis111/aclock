This is termlib for VxWorks 4.0.2.

Termlib is used by curses and other applications to allow them to work with 
almost any cursor-addressible terminal or terminal emulator. 

Termlib uses static variables (e.g. 'tbuf' pointer in termcap.c, return value
of tputs()), which you have to be careful about. This should not cause a 
problem unless you want to have two independent displays or other fanciness. 

It is useful to understand the historical kludge perpetrated by termlib to 
access the terminal capability currently in use by the application (e.g. 
for operations such as tgetstr()): The termcap entry is initialized by 
curses during the initscr() call, which uses tgetent() to get the termcap 
from termlib. The entry is held by curses (or other application) in a static 
character buffer ('genbuf'). The termlib routines keep their own static 
character pointer, 'tbuf', which points at 'genbuf'. If you call tgetstr(), 
then termlib uses 'tbuf' to look through the termcap entry being used by 
the application. As you can well imagine, this means there can be only one 
"current" termcap. To stay out of trouble, ensure that tgetent() is called
only once and from only one task.
