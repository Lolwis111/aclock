## analog clock for text console displays and terminals and terminal emulators 

Aclock is an analog clock program for text mode console displays, terminals, or terminal emulators. This program is obviously absolutely useless, except for turning your old, expensive mainframe or supercomputer into a wall clock.

Aclock binaries have been compiled for nearly 250 computer system platforms. Most of them are [contributed](https://github.com/tenox7/aclock/blob/master/contrib.txt).

Some aclock builds have a bootable disks available under [bootimages/](https://github.com/tenox7/aclock/tree/master/bootimages).

For source code, available are Curses, Termcap and AAlib for more modern systems, ANSI and K&R style. Provided are also specific, non-unix ports. There is also a vector graphics version for Tektronix 4014/4010 or XTerm/Kermit Tek emulator. 

Finaly there is a wanted list of platforms that I'm seeking to get a port or build. Some of them may be have a monetary reward.
